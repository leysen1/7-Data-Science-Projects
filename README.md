# Data Science Projects

## Tanzania Water - Classification Problem
The aim was to predict whether a particular well is functional, needs repair or is broken.

</br>https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/data/
</br>I cleaned and prepped the data in R, then in a Python notebook used a Random Forest Classifer and XGBoost methods to model the data.

## House Prices - Feature Engineering and Regression
A Kaggle competition where the aim was to predict the price of a house.

</br>After clean and feature engineering I experimented with methods such as information gain, chi squared selection, forward and backward stepwise selection, ridge and lasso regression and cross validation. Written in R.

## Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Naive Bayes and SVM
The aim was to predict whether a particular tweet mentioning an airline was positive, neutral or negative.
</br>I performed Naive Bayes and SVM models on the data using tm and caret libraries in R.

## Madrid Pollution - Regression
The aim was to predict nitrogen dioxide levels in the city of Madrid based on other pollution and weather data. Written in R.

# Spark Regression
The aim was to predict the bike rental demand on any given hour and weekday. Data from the city of Washington DC and can be sent on request. Written in Python.

# Titanic Null Imputation
The aim was to imputate the null values in the titanic data in an intelligent manner that would benefit a regression model. Written in Python.

# Data Visualisation in Python
The aim was to experiment with data visualisation in Python. I used seaborn and bokeh.
