</br>I cleaned and prepped the data in R, then in a Python notebook used a Random Forest Classifer and XGBoost methods to model the data.

## House Prices - Feature Engineering and Regression
A Kaggle competition where the aim was to predict the price of a house.

</br>After clean and feature engineering I experimented with methods such as information gain, chi squared selection, forward and backward stepwise selection, ridge and lasso regression and cross validation.

## Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Naive Bayes and SVM
The aim was to predict whether a particular tweet mentioning an airline was positive, neutral or negative.
</br>I performed Naive Bayes and SVM models on the data using tm and caret libraries in R.
